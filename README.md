# Reactive-Path-Planning-with-Potential-Fields-for-Panda-Robot
This repository contains my solution for implementing a potential field planner for the Panda robot. Using attractive and repulsive forces, the planner navigates the robot reactively in various environments, tested both in simulation and on the physical robot.
